#to add, invaild gives1 mroe chance, the first invail does nto count rtoward score.--- done
#- counts as invaid and another chance. --- done
#comment on every def and loop
#clarify invaild inputs do not count towards final score --- done



''' 
Need help---
it says the user only did 5 question even if it was 3 etc
the invailds are counting 2x even if they shouldnt be counting once.
ie 3 questions selected, put it is then saying 3 of 7 correct
the first invaild try is counting towards socre (percentage) how i think its working
skipped questions aka enter is sometimes working towards score and sometimes not- sometimes they count and sometimes not
